(go over this code and what it is doing.)

- need to go over context and scope within JavaScript.


-CommonJS allows the inclusion and execution of JavaScript in other files by using: →
export or module.exports in a module to specify what functions, classes, or objects are allowed to be included
the require function to bring in exported objects…



***************** Go over why the moduleP.js and main.js files cannot find moduel. ****************************************** 



Your JavaScript modules contains two "built-in" variables:

__filename: absolute path to the module file, including file name
__dirname: the absolute path to the directory containing the file
Note that:

if used in the "main" file, then it's the path to the main file
if used in a module, both are the path to that module, even if the module is included!
